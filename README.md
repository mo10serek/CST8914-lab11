## Question 1

When testing with the keyboard, there are no keyboard interaction missing. I test it with the `Enter`, `Space`, `Tab`, and `shift + Tab` keys and they are working fine.

## Question 2

Aria values that are missing are **aria-expanded**, **aria-controls**, and region role are missing in the div tags and **aria-expanded**, **aria-controls**, and in the button tags. Also, Ids are missing in the button and div tags so they can't reference to each other.
